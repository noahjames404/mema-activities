# Mema Activities

There are numerous ways to make a program, and it's up to you on how you'll make it work. Developers don't have to memorize it all, you just have to know the flow and get schwifty about it. If you can't finish it today, you can always do it tomorrow. 

If you have any complaints or suggestions, please email me on yanganoah404@gmail.com.
